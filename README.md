üî¨ Interactive UMAP Visualizer
This is a Streamlit web application for interactively visualizing pre-processed single-cell data. You can upload your own data in the .h5ad format, filter it by cell metadata, and generate UMAP plots colored by metadata or gene expression.

‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
Python 3.8+

pip package manager

üöÄ Installation
Download the code:
Download the application files (app.py, requirements.txt, etc.) and place them in a new folder on your computer.

The app should automatically open in a new tab in your web browser. If it doesn't, your terminal will provide a local URL (usually http://localhost:8501) that you can visit.

Basic Instructions
Once the application is running, you can:

Upload your data: Use the file uploader in the sidebar to select and upload your .h5ad file.

Filter cells: Choose a metadata column and select the values you want to keep.

Generate plots: Select metadata columns or genes to color your UMAP plots.

Download plots: Click the "Download Plot" button to save your visualizations as PNG images.

Note: The application expects the uploaded .h5ad file to contain UMAP coordinates in adata.obsm['X_umap'].
